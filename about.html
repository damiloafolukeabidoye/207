<h1>
       BIOGRAPHY
</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>DAMILOLA FOLUKE </strong>,i was born on the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> of November,199* in Ajegunle,Lagos State Nigeria..
<br><div>i attend both my primary and secondary school in <b>Florence Day School</b> Abule Tutun,Lagos state.Going to this school really happy me academically,i graduated at year 2014.
and further more as and <b>Under Graduate in Kwara State University studing Computer Science</b>.
I dont really have best food but there are some foods i love to take like Beans and Pantain,Plantain and Egg,Rice and Beans and fanily Pounded Yam with Vegetable soup.
i love taking Apple and Banana also.
My best color is <b>Yellow,White and Black.</b> but i prefer the combination of <b>White and Black</b> for my Outfit.I love to be around my Love Ones to have fun and gist,not the party type
but attend some when  neccesary especially when invited from a very important and love person.Am also the type that loves girl but always careful of my self of those i keep around me,because 
am really not the type that has enough Male friends but cool with those i do.</div>

<br>Furthermore,before gaining admission into <b>KWASU</b>,i discover some little talent which i decide to bring out of me(Lamp Making using wood)
thinking towards me andis also give me a little opportunity to meet and work for people i never think i will and this never gave me the chance to relent rather to work hard and keep
praying for <strong>GRACE</strong>.
Also as a human being i have my dislikes also which most of the people close to me know few for those care too and one of it is someone taking me for granted or fooling themselves thinking 
they are fooling me,no one love lies and and i hate that also and everyone has their past meaning the little opportunity i have now does not come easy because as a kid have faced a lot of 
challenges but some <strong>GRATEFUL ALMIGHTY ALLAH</strong> never let me down.
